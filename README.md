# Macrolide-Esterase-online-AMR-
A curated and continuously updated collection of experimentally validated macrolide esterase with standardized nomenclature.
Macrolide Esterase (MLE) Nomenclature Repository

#**Why this repository exists?** 

Macrolide esterases (MLEs) are a rapidly expanding class of antimicrobial resistance enzymes identified across clinical, veterinary, and environmental bacteria through large-scale genome and metagenome sequencing. However, existing nomenclature systems (e.g., Ere and Est) are fragmented, ambiguous, and poorly scalable, leading to inconsistent annotation and misinterpretation of MLE diversity. This repository was established to provide a unified, scalable, and function-oriented nomenclature framework for macrolide esterases, aiming to improve clarity, consistency, and interoperability while remaining compatible with existing resistance gene names.

#**How the MLE nomenclature works**

The MLE nomenclature is organized into four hierarchical levels:

**1. Functional scope – Macrolide Esterase (MLE)**

Defines enzymes that inactivate macrolide antibiotics through ester bond hydrolysis.

**2. Class level – Mechanistic classification**

MLEs are assigned to one of two mechanistic classes based on conserved protein domains and catalytic mechanisms:

Class-Ere: erythromycin esterase–type enzymes

Class-Est: α/β hydrolase–type enzymes

**3. Family level – Evolutionary lineage**

Families are defined based on amino acid sequence similarity

Assignment to an existing family requires ≥80% sequence identity and ≥80% full-length alignment coverage

Novel evolutionary lineages are assigned new three-letter family codes

**4. Variant level – Exact sequence differentiation**

Variants share 100% amino acid sequence identity and 100% alignment coverage

Distinct variants are numbered sequentially to ensure unambiguous identification

An assignment workflow based on protein domain annotation, sequence identity thresholds, and phylogenetic analysis (when necessary) is provided to ensure reproducible and transparent classification.
